      <p>Apache Forrest is a publishing framework that transforms
      input from various sources into a unified presentation
      in one or more output formats. The modular and extensible
      plugin architecture is based on Apache Cocoon and relevant
      standards, which separates presentation from content.
      Forrest can generate static documents, or be used as a
      dynamic server, or be deployed by its automated facility.</p>
