        This is a collection of notes to assist with certain project planning
        and to co-ordinate development. When the development work is complete,
        then these docs can be removed because all of the content will have
        moved into the documentation proper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refer to the <a href="site:bugs">Issue Tracker</a> for further specific
        information. Try to keep these notes, and the issues, as concise as
        possible.
