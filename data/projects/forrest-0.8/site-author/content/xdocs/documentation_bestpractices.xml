      <p>
        All help is welcome building and maintaining Forrest documentation. But
        please take the time to read this before you start.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
            Never physically move an existing file in docs unless you really
            have to. Consider the alternative of moving the file in site. See
            site for examples.
          </p></li>
        <li><p>
            If you physically move a file, make sure you add an entry in the
            section '# Some moved documents' of
            <code>site-author/content/.htaccess</code>. The entry will redirect
            visitors from old (invalid) urls to the new URL of a resource and
            should look like this:
            <br/>
            <code>RedirectMatch ^/[old URL] http://[new URL]</code>
          </p></li>
