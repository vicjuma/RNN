This skin is inteded to replicate the main ASF "branding" at http://www.apache.org/

It does not provide the three column layout, we'll do that when the Dispatcher is more stable.

This is a skin for use in the interim since many projects are demanding a simpler look and feel.

There are many unsupported features in this skin, it really should be a view. But...


TODO
====

- Colour scheme - not checked things like the MOTD colours, table backgrounds etc.

- menus - make javascript switchable in skinconf.xml

- search box - colour is wrong and it doesn't look right in the default position
