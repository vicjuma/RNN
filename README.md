# RNN
Using recurrent neural networks as a code review tool

RNNs, acquired their name based on how they function. They work by performing the same computation on each element of the sequence, while conditioning the output being on the previous computations. A typical RNN Recurrent neural networks are an important concept in the study of time series sequential data. They can store important information from previous inputs. This is unlike feed-forward neural networks which give output
only based on the current inputs fed into the model. The main reason RNN were brought into play was because they can store some important information while predicting the future output.
